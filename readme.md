# Welcome to GDApp!
This app is designed to help Genshin Impact players to organise their daily tasks more effectively.
## Main features:
### 1. Character Tab
- This app saves your character details per character. To open a character overview, search for the character and click on its icon.
- The resulting window allows you to "build" the character in the app. Select a desired weapon, and up to two artifact sets.
- You can additionally list the weapon materials for the selected weapon, selected artifact sets or talent materials for this character.
- The talent materials include materials from weekly domains. You do not need to specify them separately.
- When you are done, click SAVE button. The button will not be clickable unless you make any change in the window.
- You can click X in the top right corner to hide the character overview window.
### 2. Weapon Tab

- This tab provides an overview of all weapons in the game. The list can be fitered per category or listed status.
- Every weapon is in an information panel containing its image, the image of the weapon material associated with it,
a checkbox that lists it, and a label with its type.
- Clicking on the checkbox will "list" the weapon. Weapons already listed for a character cannot be listed again.
- Clicking on the checkbox will also save its new listed status.
### 3.Domain Tab

- This tab provides an overview of all domains.
- Domains for which nothing has been listed can be filtered out.
- Domain materials which are not available on the selected day are greyed out.
- The default selected day is today. It is a filter option and can be changed.
- Every domain card is clickable, which opens a full overview of it.
- In the new window, all characters that have this material listed will be shown.
- If it's a weapon material, all listed weapons that need this material will be shown.
- For reference reasons, all non-artifact domains also show all unlisted characters or weapons that need it, separately.
- Artifact domains only show listed characters, as technically speaking, all characters can be equipped with any set.
### 4. Saving

- Saving is done via JSON parser, which creates the json file on the disk. 
- It is highly inadvisable to tamper with it via text editors. (You may break the application!)
